This module provides datatypes for storing SHA-1, SHA-2 and MD5 hashes.

Installation:

make
make install
make installcheck (optional)
psql -f sha.sql $PGDATABASE.

Usage:

The module implements sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384 sha512 and md5hash
datatypes You can apply basic comparison operators on these types and use them
with indexes. Both btree and hash indexes are supported. See sql/sha.sql for
usage examples.

Removal:
psql -f uninstall_sha.sql $PGDATABASE.

Note:
The name of the type for storing md5 hash values is md5hash to avoid conflicts
with the internal function called md5.
